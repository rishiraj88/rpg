# Role-Playing Game with Melee Capabilities
RPG with CLI. Let's be game!

## Terms
- player: who plays and enjoys the game.
- token / character: what moves around and fights "in the gameplay".

## Functionalities implemented
- As a Player, I can create a character (token).
- As a Player, I can explore a game scene (playground).
- Fighting increments the score of the character during a gameplay. It is a parameter for the experience rating of the player character.
- Game can be saved and loaded.

## Instructions to run, build and extend
- Right now, open the project directory using a Java-capable IDE. Run `Main` class.
- A JAR may also be built and run.
- Potential code points 'reserved' for feature addition are marked with `//??`. Those are open discussion points for prioritisation and inclusion in next release cycles.

## Task List
- [Done] Code cleanup, including removing commented code lines, except for the extension points.
- [Done] Checking and fixing the access levels of the members of types (classes, enums, interfaces, ...).
